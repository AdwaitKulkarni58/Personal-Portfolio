                <h3>Design and Development</h3>
                <p>Ever since I wrote my first line of code in the Python programming language, I have been falling in love with the process of design and development repeatedly and this website is just one small example of it! Writing and testing quality code is not just my hobby, but also my belief!</p>

                <h3>Reading, Learning, and Imbibing</h3>
                <p>Who likes to read books and learn new things? Well, many people do. But what do I like to do in addition to that? I like to imbibe what I read in my daily life, and use the knowledge I gain, in the work I do. After all, learning new things is the way of life!</p>

                <h3>Experimenting by Making Mistakes</h3>
                <p>Yes, you read that right. I make mistakes many times just like any other human being but what I like about making mistakes is the opportunity to explore and improve upon what I already know. The feeling of setting those gears of the brain in motion and fixing and making adjustments to existing code, trying to think about what can be done to make the application run efficiently, is one of my favorite pastimes!</p>
